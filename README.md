Please read below for a detailed description:

This game is called EVADE and consists of 3 mini games called Investigations. The theme revolves around a detective who is searching for clues.
	
MINI-GAME 1) 
Car with acceleration control that searches for clues. The player has to evade the light of the guards. 
Player cannot touch walls or score cannot be less than 0 else game ends. Player earns points for clues and rewards increase as game progresses.  
The lasers of the enemy also cause more damage as player progresses through levels. 
Difficulty of obstacles also increases in every level along with more enemies.
There are 5 levels In this mini-game.			

MINI-GAME 2) 
A while loop and number generator determine the number of clues player has to find. Global variable "result" is used in functions player2(); and player2new();.
As a result the respective number of clues are hidden under various objects. The Clue meter goes off during every click that triggers
the sound of a clue found.   

MINI-GAME 3)
Dodge the incoming rocks.
The number of rocks increase when score is high and decrease when score is low. Uses splice to do this.
